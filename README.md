## Goals/TODO

- [x] Create cut functions for bins, percentiles, and score breaks.
- [x] Add formula interface for working with multiple scores, performance, and bivars.
- [ ] A function that takes the relevant fields and creates an intuitive table of the results.
- [ ] Add functionality for easily outputting score cross tables to excel with formatting.
